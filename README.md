# Sleeps
iOS app for counting down to events.

**Note**: This app is no longer under development. The app is functional and lets you create countdowns, but that's it.
There are no interesting features like notifications, and I planned to add a watchOS app but didn't.

I'm rebuilding this app from scratch using SwiftUI. Check out the [olivvysaur/Sleeps](https://github.com/olivvysaur/sleeps) repo.
